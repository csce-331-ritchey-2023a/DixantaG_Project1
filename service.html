    <h2> Sophmores Progressing in Excellence and Sustainability </h2>
    
    <p> During my time with SPIES, I worked with my peers to work towards a goal 
        of a cleaner and more <br>  Sustainable enviorment for the Bryan-College Station area. 
        We worked on park and street clean ups,<br>  and promoted better and cleaner methods to
        add to people's lives.

    <h2> Fitness Chat</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that my fitness chat is a act of service because of many reasons. For one, the main goal
        of<br> creating this app was to create this for family and friends who are unfamilar with fitness 
        would like <br> to better their body. This web chat application allows users to talk about anything they want
        through <br> channels, so there is something for everyone.
