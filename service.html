    <div class = "pbox1"><h2> Sophmores Progressing in Excellence and Sustainability </h2>
    
        <p> During my time with SPIES, I worked with my peers to work towards a goal 
            of a cleaner and more Sustainable enviorment for the Bryan-College Station area.
            We held events such as Slolympics which was a competition for the Sophmore leadership
            organizations here on campus. We did things from planning events and designing shirts.  
            We worked on park and street clean ups. In these clean ups we looked for all types of trash that could
            be picked up, but it was also another way for us to bond with eachother. Another similar event was the 
            <a href = "https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big event</a> which is a one day project to help the residents of Bryan-College Station. We were
            each given a goal to achive for the residents, and as a team we would get it done by the end of the day. This
            was a great way to give back to the community as a thank you. We also promoted better  and cleaner methods to add to people's lives.

    <div class = "pbox2"> <h2>Fitness Chat</h2>  
        <p>
            I believe that my fitness chat is a act of service because of many reasons. For one, the main goal
            of creating this app was to create this for family and friends who are unfamilar with fitness 
            would like to better their body. For begginers, they seem to have a lot questions regarding fitness, so this web chat 
            application allows users to talk about anything they want through channels. A lot of my information on fitness came
            from social media and personal annecdotes. Users can get their information from multiple people, and the people 
            I listen to most is JPG Coaching and Paul Carter on Tik-tok as they have the most valuable information. Goals do
            vary tho based on the style of traing the user is going for.  My main goal for this application is for people to further 
            their fitness knowledge, and better their health.
