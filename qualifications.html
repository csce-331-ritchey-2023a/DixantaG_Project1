    <p> My Technical Skills include Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS 
        Verilog, and Assembly. With Computer Engineerign combining both software  
        and hardware, I have taken a liking to the software side much more. Lately I have 
        been much more intersted on what the backend of software enginnering entails, and  
        since ChatGPT I have been more intrested in AI.
