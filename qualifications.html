    <p> My Technical Skills include Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>

        and hardware, I have taken a liking to the software side much more. Lately I have <br>
        been much more intersted on what the backend of software enginnering entails, and <br> 
        since ChatGPT I have been more intrested in AI.
