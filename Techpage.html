        <p style = "color:black"> For my first every project I was able to learn three
            languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this project 
            I accompanied a development team that constructed a webpage framework 
            Communicated with team members on front-end integration, and
            Implemented React components that enhanced UI functions of the webpage.

        <p style = "color:black"> Since I am a Computer Engineering Major I have been able to work on both the hardware 
            and software projects. One of the projects I completed was a single cycle processor which
            was primarly made with Verilog. In this project I designed a single cycle processor with a control 
            unit and data path that aided in converting instructions sent to the processor, increased speed of 
            processor by 15% through better arranged data paths, and continuously stored and converted instructions 
            from memory and registers

    <a href = "https://github.com/DixantaG/FitChat" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class = "pbox3"> <h2> Project #3: FitChat</h2>
        <p style = "color:black"> FitChat is currently a project that I am working on, and it has been my favority project that I have
            worked on as well.  By using JavaScript and the React library, I am on the way of creating a chat webpage
            appplication that allows users to communicate with others through channels.  Users will be able to create profiles, and
            there will be a username and password option as well. To allow other users use the application I used Node.js in order
            for it to be allowed on the server side.
