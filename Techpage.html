    <h2> Project #1: Aggie MarketPlace</h2>
    <p> For my first every project I was able to learn three
        languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this project <br>
        I accompanied a development team that constructed a webpage framework 
        Communicated <br> with team members on front-end integration, and
        Implemented React <br> components that enhanced UI functions of the webpage.
    </p>

    <h2> Project #2: Single Cycle Processor</h2>
    <p> Since I am a Computer Engineering Major I have been able to work on both the hardware <br>
        and software projects. One of the projects I completed was a single cycle processor which <br>
        was primarly made with Verilog. In this project I designed a single cycle processor with a control <br>
        unit and data path that aided in converting instructions sent to the processor, increased speed of <br> 
        processor by 15% through better arranged data paths, and continuously stored and converted instructions 
        <br> from memory and registers
    </p>

    <h2> Project #3: FitChat</h2>
    <p> FitChat is currently a project that I am working on, and it has been my favority project that I have
        worked on as well. <br> By using JavaScript and the React library, I am on the way of creating a chat webpage
        appplication that allows users <br> to communicate with others through channels.  Users will be able to create profiles, and
        there will be a username and <br> password option as well. To allow other users use the application I used Node.js in order
        for it to be allowed on the server side.
